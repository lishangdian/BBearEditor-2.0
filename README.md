My own editor demo in order to learn graphics algorithms and game engine architecture.

QT 5.7.2    OpenGL    

Recently, I update it on a daily basis. Now, it has had several functions. After it has a basic frame, I will write related documents.
I referred to some code, learning resources, UI designs, and art resources. I'm pretty thankful!
